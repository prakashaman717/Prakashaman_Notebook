> **PROJECTS**

> **Isolation of yeast from Agro-waste and Bio-ethanol Production**
>
> \[ 01/01/2021 -- 31/01/2021 \]
>
> Bioethanol is simply ethanol is a renewable energy source which is
> made by fermenting the sugar and starch components of plant. It is
> produced from the agricultural product such as corn, banana, dates,
> orange peel and other wastes. The reuse of agro-waste and bio-ethanol
> production can be potential benefits to the agro-waste management
> system and also the load on the other fuels can be cut down. The
> Bio-ethanol produced from these experiments can be used for other
> purposes after various processes and the potential load on ethanol can
> be reduced.

> **Detection of HPV-DNA from Cervical Scarp and Cancer Epidemiological
> Studies**

> HPV is the prominent cause of cervical cancer in India and across the
> globe. HPV is a highly contagious virus spread by various means and is
> a potential threat to women\'s health and public health also. A pap
> smear test is normally done for cervical cancer but the HPV-DNA testing by RT-PCRb is the sure-shot method for testing. The combined project of the Gynecology Department and Research Department at MCS showed the     |prevalence of                                                     HPV-DNA even in the women having pap-negative test results. Also, with
> the help of RT-PCR the HPV DNA was amplified, and concluded that the
> high risk of cervical cancer in women.

> To study the Gall Bladder patient\'s data and analysis of the region
> having the most numbers. It was concluded that the river-side areas
> have the most number of patients due to the arsenic contamination and
> arsenic administration in their bodies.
