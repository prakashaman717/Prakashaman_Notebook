#Open For Science 

I believe the scientific endeavor is best served by transparent and reproducible work. It is my goal to participate in open science and share not only outcomes but process.

My notebook documents thoughts, analyses, knowledge gains, roadblocks, detours, and products. My goal is to facilitate scientific advancement through the open sharing of data and analytical approaches. As with science, this notebook is a work in process, hopefully advancing with every iteration. 

The notebook is platformed on GitHub and is directly linked to GitHub repositories that contain further details than will be presented in notebook posts. The notebook and repositories are dynamic real-time documents.
