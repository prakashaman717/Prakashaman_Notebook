## In Situ Hybridization

**In 96 well plates**

**Jenifer/Villefranche Method Revised**

A. ***[Rehydration of the Embryos]***

1.  Use a P-1000 to transfer 100-150 ul of fixed embryos to a well in
    the 96 well plate

2.  Add 100 ul of 50% MeOH/50% 1X TBST to the embryos and allow them to
    settle for 5 min at RT

3.  Wash the embryos with 150 ul of 50% MeOH/50% 1XTBST for 5 min at RT

4.  Wash the embryos with 150 ul of 1X TBST for 5 min at RT

B. ***[Prehybridization and Hybridization]***

1.  Prehybridize the embryos for 45 min to 1 hr at 65\*C in 150 ul of
    hybridization mix

2.  Hybridize the embryos overnight at 65\*C in 150 ul of hybridization
    mix with 0.5 ng/ul of probe.

3.  Wash: 15 min in 150 ul of hybridization mix at 65\*C

> 15 min in 150 ul of 50% hybridization mix/50% 2X SSCT at 65\*C
>
> 15 min in 150 ul of 2X SSCT at 65\*C
>
> 15 min in 150 ul 0.2X SSCT at 65\*C
>
> 15 min in 150 ul 0.1X SSCT at 65\*C
>
> 5 min in 150 ul of TBST at RT

C. ***[Detection of the Probe]***

1.  Block the embryos in 150 ul of blocking solution (5% BSA and 2%
    heat-inactivated goat serum in 1X TBST) for 45 min to 1 hour at RT

2.  Incubate the embryos in 150 ul of Anti-Dig antibody (Roche) diluted
    1:2000 in blocking solution for 1 1/2 to 2 hours at RT

3.  Wash 2X 15 min then 4X 10' with 150 ul of 1X TBST at RT

4.  Wash 2X 5 min with 150 ul of phosphate buffer I at RT

5.  Incubate the embryos in 150 ul of phosphate buffer II in the dark.
    Watch the color reaction---it can take 30 minutes to several hours.

6.  To stop the color reaction, wash the embryos with 150 ul of 50 mM
    EDTA in 1X PBST once for 5 min and a second time for 10 min at RT.

7.  Wash 3X 5 min in 150 ul of 1X PBST at RT. The embryos can be stored
    in the plates at 4\*C for several days

8.  Replace the PBST with 60 ul of 50% glycerol/50% 1X PBST and mount
    the embryos on slides with coverslips (\~25 ul)
